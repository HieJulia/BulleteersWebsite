# BulleteersWebsite

Responsive social website was created for all motorcycle enthusiasts, who come together and share their experiences.

Designed a MVC pattern in order to provide a cleaner code, keeping in mind good UX principles like minimizing the number of clicks, keeping it simple and at the same time providing a great UI.

Plugged in MySQL to provide database connectivity for the web application. The application has been deployed over a web server (Apache Tomcat).
Hibernate ORM was used for object relational mapping and caching between application and MySQL. Concepts like reduced data base calls, prevention of SQL Injection, Cross site scripting were followed.

The users can log into their accounts and register for the different bikerâ€™s trips which have been posted in their club by other riders, or create their own ride/trip. The riders could upload their trip pictures, send messages to fellow riders.

The user's can also register as merchandise sellers, providing their advertisments on the web page to attract the bikers.

The home page has a user blog, where Infinite Scrolling has been implemented as you reach at the end of the page.
